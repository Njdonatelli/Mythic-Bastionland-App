        "description": "<p>I&rsquo;ve ragged on games before for wasting my time with bespoke calendars.<em>Traveller</em>&rsquo;s names for weekdays are running jokes in my group. It&rsquo;s the height of worldbuilding indulgence that never actually matters at the table, right?</p><p>Okay but... just let me do it this one time.</p><p>It can matter, of course, but only if you make it matter. So I&rsquo;ve tried to keep things simple and focused on things that might actually affect the game, such as times when important events occur, or how certain days of the week affect peoples&rsquo; behaviour.</p><p>This is more detail than I&rsquo;m actually including in<em>Mythic Bastionland</em>itself, so take it or leave it for your game.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start at the top.</p><h2><strong>Seasons</strong></h2><p>Seasons do not obey a rigid calendar, their whims known only to the Seers.</p><p>These are already covered in the book and focus on the very broad strokes of Spring, Harvest, Winter.</p><p>From a purely gameplay perspective the main thing here is that Winter sucks for travel, and if you&rsquo;re invested in a particular Holding then you&rsquo;ll care about how well the Harvest turns out.</p><h2><strong>Months</strong></h2><p>Each season is broken into three months of variable length, typically around 40 days. These might be hurried through or strung out as the season progresses. As always, the Seers understand this.</p><p>The three months fit nicely onto the existing details of each Season as written in the book. Here they&rsquo;re expanded a little and named, keeping the focus on why a player Knight would actually care which month it is.</p><h3>SPRING</h3><ol><li><strong>Sprouts</strong>- First shoots of green are coming through. The Feast of the Sun is all excess and revelry, so lots of room for messy drama to occur in and out of court. Bloody contests are encouraged, believing it strengthens the land for the year ahead.</li><li><strong>Petals</strong>- Blossoms paint the Realm in every colour. Sceptremass brings all the local rulers together to renew their vows of loyalty at the Seat of Power. Big events could occur at this gathering, or at an individual Holding while the ruler is away.</li><li><strong>Leaves</strong>- The peak of ripening growth, rising up to the longest day. The Tax begins, collecting coins from the wealthy inhabitants of the Realm, Knights often sent along as escort.</li></ol><h3>HARVEST</h3><ol><li><strong>Bales</strong>- The land turns gold and the first hay is cut. The Feast of the Stars is the best day for weddings, knighthoods, and hosts the most important tournaments of the year.</li><li><strong>Bushels</strong>- As the breeze cools, amber grains and ripe fruits are reaped in vast quantities. Eldermass is a secret gathering of Seers, which Knights are unlikely to be directly involved with, but are often summoned by Seers afterward to work their agendas.</li><li><strong>Barrels</strong>- A chill runs through the air as the leaves fall. Meat, beer, and bread is loaded into storage for the winter. The Tithe begins, a portion of all foodstuffs taken into the ruler&rsquo;s store, often putting a strain on the people of the Realm. Knights are called on to manage this.</li></ol><h3><strong>WINTER</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Pyres</strong>- First frost is fought back with the roaring fires of the Moon Feast, a solemn festival often combined with a census of the Realm&rsquo;s inhabitants.</li><li><strong>Hearths</strong>- The Realm lies quiet in its death shroud, the people huddled inside at their fires. Kindlemass is a lone reason for some to venture toward their neighbours to offer or partake of hospitality. Generous rulers see this as an opportunity to bring the people together, while others see it as an excuse to receive lavish gifts.</li><li><strong>Candles</strong>- Rivers stir, snow turns to damp earth, and the cold air reveals a hint of freshness. The Levy begins, collecting a share of raw materials and crafted goods from across the Realm, taking them back to the Holdings and Seat of Power. Travel is still difficult at this time, so Knights are expected to offer their service.</li></ol><h2><strong>Days</strong></h2><p>A Week is nine days. Think of it as three sets of three days.<br>The first day in each set is a normal working day.<br>The second day in each set is considered lucky for a particular activity, but generally treated as another working day. The third day is traditionally a break from daily work for some other purpose.<br>Most honour this in some form.</p><ul><li><strong>Stoneday</strong>- Named for the hills and mountains of the Realm.</li><li><strong>Woodsday</strong>- A lucky day for hunting, fishing, foraging, or finding lost things.</li><li><strong>Armsday</strong>- Those who can fight must train, others support them.</li><li><strong>Riverday</strong>- Named for the waters of the Realm.</li><li><strong>Silverday</strong>- A lucky day for trade and travel.</li><li><strong>Kinsday</strong>- All should visit their kin, especially those in need.</li><li><strong>Skyday</strong>- Named for the heavens above the Realm.</li><li><strong>Rainsday</strong>- Considered a lucky day if it rains.</li><li><strong>Stillday</strong>- A day of fasting, peace, and contemplation.</li></ul><p>Months can change on any day, and successive days of that type are named &ldquo;the first, the second&rdquo; etc.</p><p>So a chronicler might describe a particular date as &ldquo;the third Armsday of Bushels&rdquo; which would be roughly three weeks into the month of Bushels, at the first month of Harvest.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Much has been discussed about the ease or deadliness of combat in Mythic Bastionland and I think the following can all be true at the same time.</p><ol><li><span></span>Combat is fast and brutal and a well-prepared group of Knights can be pretty devastating. I like having a high damage output and it fits my pursuit of decisive combat.</li><li><span></span>Using a Gambit to impair an enemy attack can lead to a sort of “stun lock” situation, where the fast combat also becomes quite a safe-feeling combat, which isn’t something I want to happen in every case.</li><li><span></span>This problem is especially prevalent in groups of four or more Knights, as while damage has diminishing returns from multiple attackers, those larger groups will gain progressively more dice to spend on Gambits without any real restriction.</li></ol><p>So if you’re playing with a larger group of Knights and want to avoid this situation, there are a few optional levers you can pull on in isolation or combination with each other.</p><p>I've tried to avoid big blunt rule changes, so these are intended to be a more gentle retooling of what's already there. </p><h3><strong>Lever 1 - No Gambit Stacking</strong></h3><p>For Gambits other than Bolster, each enemy may only be the target of a specific type of gambit once per turn.</p><p>In effect, if they pass their Save to resist a particular type of Gambit they cannot be the target of that gambit type again this turn. </p><p>For example: Two Knights roll attack dice of 8, 5, 4, 1. They spend the 5 to attempt to Impair the enemy’s weapon, but the enemy passes their VIG Save. Now they cannot attempt another “impair their weapon” gambit against the target this turn, even if they wanted to use the 8 as a Strong Gambit.</p><h3><strong>Lever 2 - Resistant Natural Weapons</strong></h3><p>Natural weapons such as claws, tramples, and bites, cannot be Impaired by the “impair their weapon” gambit. A Strong Gambit can apply the “greater effect” option to attempt this, but the target receives a Save as normal.</p><p>Note that this goes against the example on the Gambit page of the Oddpocrypha.</p><h3><strong>Lever 3 - Secondary Attacks for Big Enemies</strong></h3><p>A lot of the “solo enemies” in the book have multiple attacks, so if you impair the Wyvern’s “Bite and Throw” attack then it can still use its “Sting” attack at full strength.</p><p>A few don’t, such as the Spider which only has a “bite” attack, so is left vulnerable if this is impaired.</p><p>If your Myth has a big monster like this that’s likely to be fighting a group of Knights on its own I’d recommend giving them a secondary attack of some sort. If in doubt then a classic d8 slam can represent them throwing their weight at the enemy. Just make sure this is weaker than their main attack. </p><h3><strong>Lever 4 - Uncertain Initiative</strong></h3><p>Shift the “Surprise” rules slightly so that for a standard combat, where both sides start aware of each other, players must pass a CLA Save or miss the first turn. Those that pass then act first as normal. This means for an average group of Knights only half of them are going to act on the first turn, tempering the power of that first onslaught. </p><p>If the players truly have the drop on their enemy then they all act first as normal. Likewise, if the players are ambushed then the enemy attack first. </p><p><br /></p>",

        "description": "<div><p>The <em>Mythic Bastionland</em> realm creation procedure suggests a 12x12 hex Realm, but I've drifted more toward 12x18 mostly because it's a nice easy fit to print out on a regular piece of paper. A side-effect of this is that the realm feels a little bit sparser, so I sometimes compensate by including a few more landmarks than normal.</p><p>Lately I've also been experimenting with some alternative landmark types. The book has six, which I think work well together, so I'd use this as extras to include alongside them.</p><h3><strong>Bridges</strong></h3><p>Each guarded by a knight. Non-knights may pass peacefully, but knights can only cross if one of the company defeats the knight in single combat. The duel continues until one side yields, which the bridge knight will do only when mortally wounded.</p><p>Defeating a bridge knight allows permanent passage for your company and grants 1 Glory.</p><h3><strong>Ponds</strong></h3><p>These mirrored pools are especially hard to find, only discovered on a wilderness roll of 6 when passing through. They are always placed in pairs, scattered through the realm and plunging into one provides instant passage to the paired pond elsewhere. Perhaps some pairs even span to distant realms.</p><p>Traveling through the ponds is disorienting, causing d12 CLA loss. Each pair of ponds will only transport a person once per season.</p><h3><strong>Chapels</strong></h3><p>Humble buildings built as shrines to the forces of nature, usually home to peaceful hermits. Each is dedicated to a particular animal, the hermits willing to share that beast's wisdom and a temporary use of their gifts to the worthy.</p><p>They are easy targets for raiders. If protection is not put in place then roll on the \"unresolved situations\" table between seasons to see their fate.</p><h3><strong>Grottos</strong></h3><p>Impossible to find unless a local has given you the directions. These mystic caves are three, spread across the realm. Spending the night sleeping in one, utterly alone, grants a useful vision of the past, present or future, depending on the specific grotto. Such visions are too much for a knight's mind and cause d8 CLA loss.</p><p>In spite of their similarity, Seers will strongly discourage knights from entering these places, and will scold those who have.</p><h3><strong>Fountains</strong></h3><p>Natural springs found in the most difficult to reach areas of the realm. Those stumbling on them only see the spray of their water from a distance. Water from each of the three fountains has different properties.</p><p>Red Water: A flask of this water is somehow enough to share around a whole company, providing just the refreshment needed. It can function as any Remedy type (sustenance, stimulant, or sacrament).<br>Mossy Water: When poured on the ground, this water always runs toward whichever place, person, or thing, the pourer asks for.<br>Inky Water: Anyone splashed with a flask of this water loses all of their senses until thoroughly dried out, usually a whole phase.</p><p>If the company try to take more than a single flask of water the fountain suddenly dries up until they have left.</p><h3><strong>Willows</strong></h3><p>One for each season, only emerging from the woods during their own season. These great knotted trees conceal a doorway to another world, opened by freshly spilled blood. Knights that enter are faced with a series of challenges, their reward being the fabled fruit of that particular willow. Only one fruit is present each season, and is only enough for one person to eat.</p><p>Spring Willowfruit: Creates an intense feeling of awareness, as if all distractions were washed away. Reroll CLA and keep if higher.<br>Harvest Willowfruit: Cures any ailment or curse, no matter how powerful. The eater is restored to fantastic health. Reroll VIG and keep if higher.<br>Winter Willowfruit: A truly delicious fruit, though the eater will die peacefully at the end of Winter. They know this, and find themselves surprisingly at ease. Reroll SPI and keep if higher. In spring, the eater returns to the realm as they were in their youth.</p><p>For the challenges, make a mini dungeon using the sites system, with plenty of danger. It's otherworldly, so it doesn't need to make much sense.</p></div>",

Could we ramp up that feeling?</p><p>As usual these are mostly untested variants, so use them at your own risk.</p><h3><strong>Grinding Landmarks</strong></h3><p>This is basically how Hazards already work. In short: you run into an obstacle and you either have a smart way around (often from a local guide), you turn back the way you came, or you pay d6 <span class=\"virtue\">VIG</span> to just power through.</p><p>An easy part to miss is that Hazards<em>usually</em>&nbsp;affect Vigour, but can also target other Virtues. There was a time back in development when Hazards always affected Vigour, but Curses and Ruins reduced Clarity and Spirit respectively.</p><p>I won't go into why that changed, but you could easily slip it back in if you want your Realm to feel more hostile. Treat Curses and Ruins exactly as they are now, but add in the respective d6 <span class=\"virtue\">CLA</span>/<span class=\"virtue\">SPI</span> loss.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Costly Actions</strong></h3><p>What about spending Virtue actively as a resource to get a little bonus?</p><p>Feats used to work this way, but the main example of this in the final rules is Galloping an extra Hex at the cost of d6 <span class=\"virtue\">VIG</span> loss to the steed. What ways could we offer for the Knights themselves to spend their Virtues?</p><p><strong>Exert</strong>- Lose d6 <span class=\"virtue\">VIG</span> to treat a Gambit you perform as a Strong Gambit instead.&nbsp;<br><strong>Commune&nbsp;</strong>- Spend a phase sleeping and lose d6 <span class=\"virtue\">CLA</span> to receive a cryptic dream from a known Seer.<br><strong>Rally</strong>- Spend an action and lose d6 <span class=\"virtue\">SPI</span> to remove<em>Fatigue</em>status from one Ally.</p><p>If the Virtue loss from any of these actions takes that Virtue to 0 then the attempt fails.&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect these are broken but it's a fun idea to play with.</p><h3><strong>Bringing Back Burdens</strong></h3><p>Going without sleep and travelling at night are both \"bad decisions\" that cause <span class=\"virtue\">CLA</span>/<span class=\"virtue\">SPI</span> loss respectively. You could argue these sit in the same category as Galloping, paying a price to get more action, but they feel different to me and they affect the Knight directly, not their steed.</p><p>In this vain, I've been looking for an excuse to reuse the three Burdens that featured in an older version of the game, and their helpful SAD acronym.</p><p>Annoyingly they don't match up to the Virtues in that order, but let's roll with it.</p><p><strong>Sorrow</strong>- Something bad happened.<br>Invoke when you're reminded of something awful that happened in the past.<br>Lose d6 <span class=\"virtue\">SPI</span>.<br><em>Examples: Visiting a Holding that they previously failed to protect.</em></p><p><strong>Ache</strong>- Something bad is happening.<br>Invoke when the Knight is suffering a particularly hard time right now.&nbsp;<br>Lose d6 <span class=\"virtue\">VIG</span>.<br><em>Examples: Being forced to linger in especially unpleasant living conditions.</em></p><p><strong>Dread</strong>- Something bad is going to happen.<br>Invoke when dark times are ahead and it's hard to see the glimmer of hope.&nbsp;<br>Lose d6 <span class=\"virtue\">CLA</span>.&nbsp;<br><em>Examples: Failing to stop a monstrous enemy, knowing it's now headed to attack a nearby Holding before they can get there.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Again, I think these have potential to go wrong, so use them carefully.</p>",
