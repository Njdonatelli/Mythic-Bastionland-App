A 12x12 grid is typical, whether the Realm is landlocked, coastal, or an island chain.</p><p>Typically, players get a copy of the map with Holdings and general terrain marked. They cannot see Myths, Landmarks, and Barriers.</p><p>The distance covered by each hexagon is a <strong>Hecksleague</strong>, commonly called a Hex.</p><p>This distance represents a few loose factors:</p><ol><li><span></span>The area a hill fort can overlook</li><li><span></span>The area that guards can patrol in a day</li><li><span></span>A return hike to a neighbouring Hex gets you home before dark</li></ol><h3>WILDERNESS</h3><p>Most Hexes are Wilderness, with a variety of terrain types. <a>Spark Tables</a> can help with this. As a general guide create clusters of [[/r d12]] hexes of the same terrain type.</p><p>Some Hexes have a Barrier on one or more of their edges, typically a sudden altitude change or impassible feature. These cannot normally be travelled through. For a typical Realm, place a number of Barriers equal to one sixth of your total Hexes.</p><p>Most Realms have a navigable river passing through and a few large lakes spanning whole or multiple Hexes.</p><h3>HOLDINGS</h3><p>Place 4 Holdings a good distance apart, typically castles, walled towns, fortresses, or towers, held by Knights or influential Vassals. Most of the Realm lives within their walls or the surrounding Hex.</p><p>Designate one Holding as the Seat of Power. This is the Holding of the ruler of the whole Realm, commonly a Knight.</p><h3>MYTH HEXES</h3><p>Place 6 <a href=\"/browse/myths\">Myths</a> in remote places. Number them as 1-6. The Hexes are clearly affected by the presence of their Myth.</p><h3>LANDMARKS</h3><p>Some Wilderness Hexes contain a Landmark. These are discovered when travellers roll 4-6 on the Wilderness roll. A typical Realm has 3 or 4 of each type of Landmark. Mark them with their initial or an icon.</p><p>Even characters who know a Landmark’s location must still make a Wilderness Roll to check for Omens as they travel there.</p><p>Each Landmark type covers a range of specific features, with prompts provided on Knight and Myth pages later in the book.</p><p>The course of the game may create new Landmarks or remove or alter existing ones.</p><p>The 6 types of landmarks are:</p><ul><li><span></span>@UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.gEhHqMT5ciuQNZXm]{Dwellings}</li><li><span></span>@UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.QWZ5Xsa3vuo5Bf69]{Sanctums}</li><li><span></span>@UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.lBdvsLmaxCzXExnv]{Monuments}</li><li><span></span>@UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.UuZ3UFDChYMN7gTh]{Hazards}</li><li><span></span>@UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.ihrxnfnNnK4x8KPd]{Curses}</li><li><span></span>@UUID[Compendium.celestus.rules.TuBkbx1jAFCmrp19]{Ruins}</li></ul><h3>ADDING DETAILS</h3><p><a>Spark Tables</a> can add detail to significant locations and people in the Realm.</p><h3>DISTANT REALMS</h3><p>Realms are usually bordered by water, mountains, or wasteland, though claims are often disputed. Travelling to a distant Realm normally sees you arrive in the next Season.</p>"
