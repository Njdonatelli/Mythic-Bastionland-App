# **GETTING STARTED**

One player is the Referee. They should read through to the end of the rules section.
The other players can go straight to Knighthood and need not read any further unless curious.

### START & SCOPE

Every group that sits down to play the game is different, and you should consider the Start and Scope of a game before you begin.

The **Start** is the opening situation that the players find themselves in. The **Scope** is how long you expect the game to run, both in and out of game.

### START

#### Wanderer 

Young Knights-Errant with d6GD (Guard) and d12+d6 in each Virtue. They arrive in the Realm seeking Glory. If they lack direction, have them seek a Seer's counsel.

#### Courtier
Mature Knights-Gallant with 2d6GD and d12+6 (six, not d6) in each Virtue. They have a place in Court at the Seat of Power. The first Omen of the nearest Myth is delivered as news to the Court.

#### Ruler
 Mature Knights-Tenant with d6+6GD and d12+6 (six, not d6) in each Virtue. One Knight rules a Holding, the others are in their Circle. The Seat of Power is under a wicked influence.

## SCOPES

**Adventure** - One session. Here it can save time to generate a few Knights ahead of the game and let the players choose one each.

**Chronicle** - A known number of sessions. Season and Age turns are planned out ahead of time. For six sessions this might be a Season turn at the end of each session, and an Age turn at the end of each Winter.

**Saga** - An indeterminate number of sessions. Here you can let the players guide the scope as they explore the world.

**GLORY**

All Knights seek Glory, that they might one day be deemed worthy of the City Quest.

## GLORY THROUGH MYTHS

When the group feels that a Myth has been resolved, reaching a conclusion of any type, all Knights who played a part in that Myth gain 1 *Glory*.

## GLORY BY OTHER MEANS

In a public duel or joust, Knights may stake Glory against a willing opponent. The victor gains 1 Glory, the loser loses 1 Glory.

Tournaments may also grant 1 Glory to the winning Knight, provided there are significant spectators and spectacle.

If a battle is large enough to be remembered in history, all Knights on the victorious side gain 1 Glory.

When the game moves to a new Age all Knights gain 1 Glory through serving the Realm and manoeuvring in Court.

## RANK

A Knight's Glory dictates their rank:

0 Glory - **Knight-Errant** Worthy of leading a Warband

3 Glory - **Knight-Gallant** Worthy of a seat in Council or Court

6 Glory - **Knight-Tenant** Worthy of ruling a Holding

9 Glory - **Knight-Dominant** Worthy of ruling a Seat of Power

12 Glory - **Knight-Radiant** Worthy of the City Quest

## WORTHINESS

Rank alone does not immediately grant the Knight a Council position or rule of a Holding. It merely proves their worthiness.

A Knight may find themselves in a position for which their rank is unworthy. They are sure to face initial opposition, but if this can be overcome then their worthiness is proven.

## Knighthood

You are Knights, united by a common Oath and visions of the City. You may have dreams of glory, but every Knight must accept the risk of death.

The Seers who knighted you have deemed that you travel as a **Company**. While some of you may rest, roam, or die, your collective journey will be as one.

Knights have 3 *Virtues*. Roll a value for each in order. The **Start** that you chose for your Company determines the dice you roll. If unsure, roll d12+d6.

## VIGOUR

Strong limbs, firm hands, powerful lungs.

## CLARITY

Keen instinct, lucid mind, shrewd eyes.

## SPIRIT

Charming tongue, iron will, fierce heart.

## GUARD

Roll for Guard, your skill at avoiding Wounds. The Start that you chose for your company determines the dice you roll.

## KNIGHT

Roll or choose a **Knight**.

This gives:

**Property:** Items brought with you.
**Ability:** A special talent unique to you.
**Passion:** A special means you have to restore your Spirit.
Every Knight has a dagger (d6), torches, rope, dry rations, and camping gear.
Every Knight knows the three Feats.
Every Knight has sworn the Oath: SEEK THE MYTHS, HONOUR THE SEERS, PROTECT THE REALM**

## SQUIRES

Small Companies (2 Knights or fewer) may give each Knight a Squire. They serve as apprentices, and are not yet Knights, so cannot gain Glory or perform Feats.

2d6 for each Virtue, 1GD.

They ride a pony (VIG 7, CLA 7, SPI 2, 2GD) and carry a dagger (d6).

Roll d6 for their extra equipment.

1: Cudgel (d8 hefty), 
2: Axe (d8 hefty),
3: Hatchet (d6), 
4: Shortbow (d6 long),
5: Shield (d4, A1), 
6: Three Javelins (d6).

When Knighted they gain d6 in each Virtue.

# BASIC RULES

**SAVES**

To pass a Save, roll a d20 equal or below the relevant Virtue. Failure means negative consequences, not always a failed action.

**VIRTUES**

A Virtue can be reduced and raised in a number of ways, but can never go higher than 19 or lower than 0.

**TURNS**

A Turn is enough time to Move and then perform an Action, always in that order.

**SURPRISE**

Players normally take the first turn of combat, discussing their plan and acting in any order they wish.

Characters who were not readied for combat must pass a CLA Save or miss the first turn.

**REACTION**

Non-player characters react in a way that feels appropriate for the current context.

When uncertain, a character makes a SPI Save to avoid an unfavourable reaction.

**EXPOSED**

Characters who are caught with their guard down or otherwise defenceless are *Exposed* and act as if they have 0GD. If they remedy their situation then they are no longer *Exposed*. Traps and ambushes typically catch victims *Exposed*.

**FEATS**

These special actions known by Knights can be performed as described. Using Feats risks the Knight becoming *Fatigued* which prevents them from using further Feats until they rest.

**DEATH**

Even the boldest Knight can die a sudden or ignoble death. Prepare yourself for this.

When a Knight dies the player creates a new Knight and they are added to the Company as quickly as possible. Alternatively they may assume control of a Squire or follower.

**ATTACKS**

Take the Attack dice noted on your weapon(s), shield, and granted by bonuses.

Go through the following steps in order:

- 1. All combatants attacking the same target roll their dice at the same time.
- 2. If the target or their nearby allies can *Deny*  they may use it.
- 3. Attackers may perform Gambits(.
- 4. Take the highest die remaining.
- 5. Add any extra Damage from attackers who *Bolster* the Attack ).
- 6. Subtract the target's total Armour score.
- 7. The Attack causes that much Damage.

So a Knight with a mace (d8) and shield (d4) is aided by an ally with 2 daggers (d6 each). They roll d8 and d4, and 2d6 respectively.

The dice show 7, 3, 1, and 5. The highest die is 7. The 5 is spent on a Gambit to *Bolster* the Damage to 8. The target has Armour 2 (helm and shield), reducing the Damage to 6.

*Impaired* attacks roll d4 only and cannot gain bonus dice or benefit from Feats.

*Blast* attacks target everybody in their area, rolling each separately.

**DAMAGE**

The attack's Damage is deducted from the target's GD.

If they have at least 1GD remaining then they Evade the Attack.

If it leaves them with exactly 0GD then they gain a Scar.

If it exceeds the target's GD, the excess is deducted from VIG and they are Wounded.

If they lose half or more of their remaining VIG it is a Mortal Wound. Mortally Wounded targets are down and dying. They die if left untended for an hour, but can be patched up in a few moments.

If Damage reduces the target's VIG to 0, they are Slain.

## Harm & Scars

**VIRTUE LOSS**

Virtues may be reduced by means other than Damage, typically referred to as Virtue Loss. In addition to the situations listed in the rules, characters may suffer Virtue Loss as the cost or consequence of an action. This is detailed in the Action Procedure().

Victims are only Slain or Mortally Wounded if the Virtue was reduced by Damage, never as a result of Virtue Loss.

At VIG 0 you are *Exhausted* and cannot Attack if you have moved this turn.

At CLA 0 you are *Exposed* and treated as having 0GD.

At SPI 0 your attacks are *Impaired* rolling a single d4 only.

**RECOVERY**

*Guard* is fully restored with just a moment of peace after the danger has passed. *Fatigue* is also removed this way.

**Virtues** can be fully restored by 3 means:

- Consuming a specific type of *Remedy*
- Performing a specific *Action*
- Skipping to a new *Season*

*Vigour* is restored by consuming Sustenance or spending a full day in warm hospitality.

**Clarity** is restored by consuming Stimulant or receiving guidance from a Seer.

**Spirit** is restored by consuming Sacrament or indulging a Passion.

**REMEDIES**

A single Remedy is a sizeable bundle of materials and tools. A person or dedicated beast of burden can only carry one at once.

Using a Remedy requires a whole Phase of the day, and is more about the ceremonial act than the material components themselves.

The Virtue is restored before resolving any Omens or other encounters. A single Remedy is enough to benefit all company present.

## SCARS

Take the die that caused the Scar and roll it again, consulting the table below for the specific Scar caused.

Virtue Loss through Scars is not Damage, so cannot Mortally Wound or Slay the victim.

Scars are only gained through real, deadly combat, not training or bloodless duels.

#### SCAR Distress
**1 A lucky escape** Lose d6 SPI. 
**2 Disfigurement** – *A permanent mark* Roll 1d6: 1: Eye, 2: Cheek, 3: Neck, 4: Torso, 5: Nose, 6: Jaw. If your max GD is 2 or less, increase it by d6. 
**3 Smash** – *A sudden spray of blood* Lose d6 VIG. 
**4 Stun** – *Pain drowns the senses* Lose d6 CLA If your max GD is 4 or less, increase it by d6. 
**5 Rupture** – *Innards pierced and compressed* Lose 2d6 VIG. 
**6 Gouge** – *Flesh torn from bone* When you get stitched up, if your max GD is 6 or less, increase it by d6. 
**7 Concussion** – *A heavy blow numbs the mind* Lose 2d6 CLA. 
**8 Tear** – *Something taken in violent struggle* Roll 1d6: 1: Nose, 2: Ear, 3: Finger, 4: Thumb, 5: Eye, 6: Chunk of Scalp. When you get patched up, if your max GD is 8 or less, increase it by d6 
**9 Agony** – *With a crack, a torturous break* Lose 2d6 SPI.
**10 Mutilation** – *A limb rendered lost or useless* Roll 1d6: 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Shield Arm, 5-6: Sword Arm. By next Season you have a prosthetic or have learned to get by, and if your max GD is 10 or less, increase it by d6.
**11 Doom** – *A cheated death haunts you* If you take a Mortal Wound this Season you are Slain instead.
**12 Humiliation** – *A most dolorous stroke* When you achieve revenge, if your max GD is 12 or less, increase it by d6.

## **Specifics of Combat**

## FEATS

After using a Feat the user must pass a Save or become *Fatigued*, unable to perform Feats until they rest. Each Feat can only be used once per Attack by each combatant involved.

**SMITE** - Release your righteous fury

- Use before rolling a melee Attack.
- The Attack gains either +d12 or **Blast**.
- Pass a VIG Save or become *Fatigued*.

**FOCUS** - Create an opening to exploit

- Use after rolling an Attack.
- Perform a Gambit without using a die.
- Pass a CLA Save or become Fatigued.

**DENY** - Rebuff an attack before it lands

- Use after an Attack roll against you or an ally within arm's reach.
- Discard one Attack die.
- Pass a SPI Save or become Fatigued.

#### GAMBITS

Attackers may discard any number of Attack dice of 4 or higher to perform Gambits, each causing one of the effects below. The affected foe must be a target of the original attack.

For Gambits other than *Bolster* and *Move* the target receives a VIG Save to ignore the effect.

- **Bolster** the Attack for +1 total Damage
- **Move** after the Attack, even if you already moved or are unable to move
- **Repel** a foe away from you
- **Stop** a foe from moving next turn
- **Impair** a weapon on their next turn
- **Trap** a shield until your next turn
- **Dismount** a foe
- **Other** effect of a similar level of impact

If a die of 8 or higher is used in melee then a **Strong Gambit** is performed and the attacker chooses *one* of the following:

- No Save is granted to the target
- Greater effect such as disarming an item, breaking a wooden shield or weapon, or removing a helm. This does not increase the Damage from *Bolster*.

### MINOR ACTIONS

Changing weapons, dismounting, and similar actions do not count as a combatant's action for the turn.

## BONUS ATTACK DICE

These are gained from useful information, shrewd preparations, or a tactical advantage. +d8 is a typical bonus.

#### UNARMED COMBAT

Unarmed attacks are *Impaired* unless the attacker has suitable natural weapons.

#### RANGED COMBAT

Purely ranged weapons cannot be used if the attacker began their turn engaged in melee.

Protective cover grants an additional point of Armour against ranged attacks.

#### MOUNTED COMBAT

Mounted combatants use their steed's trample Damage in addition to their own weapons when charging enemies on foot. This doesn't work against spearwalls. Steeds can be targeted separately by attacks.

Being dismounted causes d6 Damage.

## DUELS & JOUSTS

Two combatants can mutually agree to engage in a duel, or joust if mounted.

They fight as normal but their attacks are rolled and resolved simultaneously, including the effects of Gambits. Both combatants can use Feats before the attacks are resolved.

### SHIELDWALLS & SPEARWALLS

3 or more allies may form a wall formation. If they all bear shields (not bucklers) then they gain an additional point of Armour. If they all bear spears (or similar) then enemies cannot Attack on the turn that they charge.

## WAVERING MORALE

Individuals who are Wounded, or groups who lose half their number, must pass a SPI Save to avoid rout or surrender.

Organised groups roll once using their leader's SPI. Disorganised groups roll for each individual against their own SPI.

This does not affect player characters.

## WARBANDS

Two-dozen or so combatants fighting together are treated as a single Warband.

- When they are Mortally Wounded they are routed from the battle.
- At VIG 0 they are wiped out entirely, at SPI 0 they are broken.
- They are not harmed by individual attacks unless they are **Blast** attacks or suitably large-scale.
- Warband attacks against individuals receive +d12 and cause **Blast** Damage.

## LEADING FROM THE FRONT

One individual within a Warband can add their Attack dice to the Warband's Attack Roll, leading from the front. If they do, they suffer the same Damage that the Warband does until their next turn.

## WOOD AND STONE

Ships and structures are destroyed at 0GD. Recovering GD takes a day of repairs.

Wooden structures and ships ignore Attacks other than from fire, siege weapons, or suitably large creatures.

Stone walls cannot be breached by conventional means, though their gates are usually a viable target.

- Gate: 5GD, A2 
- Rampart: 10GD, A2 
- Castle Wall: 10GD, A3

Colliding ships take d12 Damage. If one ship is much larger it takes d6 Damage instead.

- **Rowboat:** 4GD, carries 6 passengers
- **Longship:** 7GD, A1, carries a Warband
- **Warship:** 10GD, A2, carries 2 Warbands

## ARTILLERY AND SIEGERY

- **Siege Tower:** 7GD, A2
- **Battering Ram:** d12
- **Stone Thrower:** d12 **Blast**
- **Bolt Launcher:** 2d12
- **Trebuchet:** 3d12 **Blast**, immobile

## RECRUITMENT

Soldiers are drawn from loyal Vassals, Knights that share a cause, or mercenaries who have agreed a price.

Whatever their origin, soldiers expect their basic needs to be met during their service.

Warbands who are ill-rested, poorly fed, or otherwise pushed too far typically lose SPI. At SPI 0 a Warband will not follow orders, acting only in their self interest.

## WARBANDS

Militia: VIG 10, CLA 10, SPI 7, 3GD Crude polearm (d8 long)

Skirmishers: VIG 10, CLA 13, SPI 10, 2GD Shortbow (d6 long)

Mercenaries: VIG 13, CLA 10, SPI 10, 4GD A3 (mail, helm, shield) Spear (d8 hefty), shield (d4)

Riders: VIG 10, CLA 13, SPI 10, 3GD Javelins (d6), handaxe (d6), steed

Knights: VIG 13, CLA 10, SPI 13, 5GD A3 (mail, helm, shield) Mace (d8 hefty), shield (d4), charger (d8 trample)

### TRADE

Only the rich deal in coins. Most trade is an exchange of raw materials, goods, or service. Frequent trades often grow into ongoing pledges of service, cooperation, or protection.

Simply, if you hope to trade you should have a good answer to the question "What can I offer that they would value?".

Common items are widely available. Uncommon items require a specialist. Rare items are truly treasured.

#### WIELDING WEAPONS

If no type is noted, assume the weapon uses one hand and has no other restrictions.

**Hefty** weapons require one hand. Only one **Hefty** item can be wielded at once. **Long** weapons require both hands and are

*Impaired* in confined environments.

**Slow** weapons cannot be used if the attacker has moved this turn. They are also **Long**.

## COMMON WEAPONS

Hefty Tools: d6 hefty (pitchfork, hatchet) 
Long Tools: d8 long (staff, logging axe, pick)
Hand Weapons: d6 (dagger, club, handaxe) 
Hefty Weapons: d8 hefty (spear, mace, axe) 
Long Weapons: d10 long (poleaxe, billhook)

Rare: Death plus speed, secrecy, or suffering

## **People & Realms**

**SERVICE** 

Holdings house a range of people who can be called on for service. The larger the Holding, the more likely that a particular service is being offered there.

Many will gladly offer their service to a Knight, but all have limits, after which they ask something in return or refuse entirely.

As with trade, the key question comes down to "What can I offer that they would value?".

Common services are offered everywhere. Uncommon services require training. Rare services require a lifetime dedication.

Roll their Virtues on d12+d6.

## COMMON

Servant: 2GD

Single duty with little expertise

Guide: 4GD

Handaxe (d6), javelin (d6), local knowledge

Sentry: 3gd

Billhook (d10 long), little appetite for combat

#### UNCOMMON

Herbalist: 2gd

Knows treatments, not cures

Soldier-at-Arms: 6GD A2 (helm, shield)

Spear (d6 hefty), shield (d4), battle worn

Archer: 3gp

Shortbow (d6 long)

#### RARE

Sage: 2GD

Holds immense knowledge in a particular area of expertise

Alchemist: 2gD

Creates poisons or quasi-medicinal potions

Sellsword: 7gd

A4 (coat, plates, helm, shield) Longsword (2d8 hefty), shield (d4)

Generally only agrees to fights that they are confident they can win

#### REALMS

- The world is fractured into petty Realms, each ruled from a Seat of Power.
- Smaller Holdings are walled settlements tended by Vassals, guarded by Knights.
- Most that lies between is wilderness.

#### MYTHS

- Stories that became truths, or are destined to come to pass.
- Nobody agrees on the details, but every version is true in some way.
- · There's no such thing as "just a myth".

#### ROLES

- Most fall into one of four roles: Vassal, Vagabond, Knight, or Seer. A web of seniority exists within and between each.
- Vassals serve a ruler, typically a Knight, in return for protection.
- Vagabonds roam, working for and protecting only themselves.

#### SEERS

- Those who understand the nature of Myth enough to glimpse into our future.
- Their visions grant legitimacy and direction to a Knight's quest.
- They know when a Squire is ready to become a Knight, and when a Knight is ready to seek the City.

#### KNIGHTS

- Those who take the Oath are held in esteem, but expectations burden them.
- They rely on their arms, but are expected to know the customs of peace.
- Usually one Knight holds each title, passed on in retirement or death.

#### FAITH

- Some believe there is truth in the sky: the stars, moon, sun, positions, and motions.
- Some look to nature: the turn of seasons, the sound of trees, the wisdom of beasts.
- Some believe the sacred stories that weave into Myths, guiding us to the City.

## **Creating a Realm**

## BREAKING THE RULES

The guidelines on this page make for a typical Realm, but they can be bent or broken in creating your own Realms.

## THE HEX MAP

A Realm is mapped on a hexagonal grid covering the loose rule of a Seat of Power. A 12x12 grid is typical, whether the Realm is landlocked, coastal, or an island chain.

Typically, players get a copy of the map with Holdings and general terrain marked. They cannot see Myths, Landmarks, and Barriers.

The distance covered by each hexagon is a Hecksleague, commonly called a Hex.

This distance represents a few loose factors:

- The area a hill fort can overlook
- The area that guards can patrol in a day
- A return hike to a neighbouring Hex gets you home before dark

## WILDERNESS

Most Hexes are Wilderness, with a variety of terrain types. Spark Tables  can help with this. As a general guide create clusters of d12 hexes of the same terrain type.

Some Hexes have a Barrier on one of their edges, typically a sudden altitude change or impassible feature. These cannot normally be travelled through. For a typical Realm, place Barriers one sixth of your total Hexes.

Most Realms have a navigable river passing through and a few large lakes spanning whole or multiple Hexes.

## HOLDINGS

Place 4 Holdings a good distance apart, typically castles, walled towns, fortresses, or towers, held by Knights or influential Vassals. Most of the Realm lives within their walls or the surrounding Hex.

Designate one Holding as the Seat of Power. This is the Holding of the ruler of the whole Realm, commonly a Knight.

## MYTH HEXES

Place 6 Myths () in remote places. Number them as 1-6. The Hexes are clearly affected by the presence of their Myth.

## LANDMARKS

Some Wilderness Hexes contain a Landmark. These are discovered when travellers roll 4-6 on the Wilderness roll. A typical Realm has 3 or 4 of each type of Landmark. Mark them with their initial or an icon.

Even characters who know a Landmark's location must still make a Wilderness Roll to check for Omens as they travel there.

Each Landmark type covers a range of specific features, with prompts provided on Knight and Myth pages later in the book.

The course of the game may create new Landmarks or remove or alter existing ones.

**Dwellings**: Humble homes amid the wilds.

**Sanctums**: Each the sacred home to a Seer. Roll on the Knight table(, consulting their page to discover which Seer.

**Monuments**: Sites of inspiration. Travellers may spend a Phase to restore SPI here as if they were consuming a Sacrament.

**Hazards**: Nature fights your every step. Devise a solution, push through (lose d6 VIG), or go back the way you came.

**Curses:** Blights on the land that throw you off course. If you travel in the next Phase it counts as travelling blind().

**Ruins**: Remnants of the past echo the future. These hint at a random Myth not currently active in the Realm, though it may return.

## **ADDING DETAILS**

Spark Tables  can add detail to significant locations and people in the Realm.

## **DISTANT REALMS**

Realms are usually bordered by water, mountains, or wasteland, though claims are often disputed. Travelling to a distant Realm normally sees you arrive in the next Season.

A Knight's journey largely focuses on travelling great distances to seek the guidance of Seers and uncover Myths.

However, on occasion there may be the need to zoom in on a single Hex, or a specific site within a Hex, in more detail.

Sites can be created as areas that warrant more detailed exploration, whether ancient tombs, hostile castles, twisting caverns, or misty woods spanning the entire Hex.

While they can be plotted out with any number of traditional methods, this is a quick Hex-based method.

## **POINTS AND ROUTES**

- 1. Draw 6 **points** as the corners of a hexagon, with a 7th in the centre.
  - a. Mark 3 points with circles. These are **features** that give information or set the mood.
  - b. Mark 2 with triangles. These are **dangers** to be navigated carefully.
  - c. Mark 1 with a diamond. This is **treasure,** a useful or valuable find.
  - d. Erase the final point and assign numbers to the remaining points.
- 2. Neighbouring points can be connected by three types of **route**.
  - a. Draw 3 **open** routes with a solid line. These are straightforward paths between points.
  - b. Draw 2 **closed** routes with a crossed line. Here something blocks the way, so creative thinking is required.
  - c. Draw 1 **hidden** route with a dotted line. This path is only found through specific exploration of its connecting points or local knowledge.
- 3. Make sure all points can be reached, even if one of the routes is closed or secret.
- 4. If applicable, place an **entrance** in any point, and an optional hidden entrance.

## **EXAMPLE - Blackmoss Isle**

**Entrance**: A small cove, a safe landing spot on the island.

**Hidden Entrance:** Locals know of a second landing, requiring careful piloting through rocks and caves.

- 1. Stony beach overgrown with toxic black moss. Dead rock pools, smashed boat.
- 2. A tattered rope bridge over jagged rocks. Carrion Gulls harass travellers, hoping to secure their next meal.
- 3. A concealed harbour. A hidden cave leads to 6. The passageway to 4 is overgrown with toxic black moss.
- 4. A former shrine to the sea, overgrown with black moss. Now the tomb of the Salt Seer.
- 5. A waterlogged cave, swirling currents sweep away anybody not secured. Tunnel to 6 is flooded by raging waters.
- 6. The Salt Seer's hoard. Valuable treasures and his Eye of the Sea.

## BREAKING THE RULES

The guidelines on this page are just a starting point. Rearrange the distribution of the types of point, route, and entrance if it suits the theme of the site better.

So a sealed burial complex might have:

Points: 3 Treasures, 2 Dangers, 1 Feature Routes: 3 Closed, 2 Secret, 1 Open Entrances: 1 Entrance only

## Refereeing

### **PRIMACY OF ACTION**

Even when using the rules for travel, exploration, and combat, remember this, the most important thing:

Past action taken by the players supersedes content generated by prompts or rules. Their deeds are reality.

Remember the core of giving players information, honouring their choices, and describing the impact of their actions.

### **GIVING INFORMATION**

The players can only make interesting choices when they are presented with difficult situations and given all of the information needed to engage with them.

### **IMPROVISATION**

When faced with a question not answered by rules, notes, or procedures, you improvise.

Anything too beneficial or too harmful creates the feeling of an arbitrary world. Instead, describe something that does at least one of the following:

- **Evokes** the flavour and themes of the area and its inhabitants.
- **Indulges** their senses. Vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste.
- **Reinforces** something that they've already learned about this place.

### **PROMPTS**

Every Knight and Myth spread has prompts across its base. These serve as cues for improvisation as needed. **Spark Tables** are also useful for generating ideas.

### **LUCK ROLLS**

If you need to consult the whims of fate, make a Luck Roll on a d6. A high roll favours the players, a low one does not.

In general, use these guidelines:

#### *LUCK ROLL*

Roll|Result

1|Crisis: Something immediately bad

2-3|Problem: Something potentially bad

4-6|Blessing: A welcome result

## **ACTION PROCEDURE**

When the players take action the Referee works down this list:

1. **Intent:** What are you trying to do?
2. **Leverage:** What makes it possible?
3. **Cost:** Would it use a resource, cause Virtue Loss, or have a side-effect?
4. **Risk:** What's at risk? No risk, no roll. Otherwise make a Save or a Luck Roll.
5. **Impact:** Show the consequences, honour the established risk, and move forward.

## **SUCCESS**

When the players succeed at a significant action the Referee does one of the following:

- **Advance:** Move in a good direction.
- **Disrupt:** Lessen a threat.
- **Resolve:** Put a problem to rest.

## **FAILURE**

When the players fail at a risky action they might still complete the action, but always suffer negative consequences:

- **Threaten:** Create a new problem.
- **Escalate:** Make a problem worse.
- **Execute:** Deliver on a threat.

## **IMPACT**

Whether a success or a failure, ensure that the players' actions have an observable impact on the world. The best types of impact have both immediate and lasting consequences, always moving things forward.

## **ENDING A SESSION**

At the end of each session:

- Discuss if it would feel right for a **Season** or **Age** to pass between now and the next session .
- If a Season or Age passes, then follow the procedure detailed.
- Ask the players if they have any plans or ambitions for the next session. This gives you a direction for any preparation you do before then.

## Each **Day** has 3 **Phases**:

- **Morning:** Sunrise to Noon.
- **Afternoon:** Noon to Sunset.
- **Night:** Sunset to Sunrise.

## Each **Year** has 3 **Seasons**:

### **Spring -** *The Green Season*

- Begins with the **Feast of the Sun**, a day of excess and revelry to strengthen both the people and the land.
- Midspring sees **Sceptremass**, where the Seat of Power gathers local rulers to renew their vows of loyalty.
- Ends with the **Tax**, a share of coins collected by the Realm.

### **Harvest -** *The Gold Season*

- Begins with the **Feast of the Stars**, a night of honours, unions, and contests.
- Midharvest sees **Eldermass**, a secretive assembly of Seers and trusted associates.
- Ends with the **Tithe**, a share of food and drink collected by the Realm.

### **Winter -** *The Grey Season*

- Begins with the **Feast of the Moon**, a solemn reflection of mortality and history.
- Midwinter sees **Kindlemass**, a sacred day of warmth and goodwill, where each home must open their doors to all.
- Ends with the **Levy**, a share of materials and crafted goods collected by the Realm.

## Each **Life** has 3 **Ages**:

- **Young:** Green, always learning.
- **Mature:** Seasoned, in their golden years.
- **Old:** Grey, considering their legacy.

When a character becomes **Mature** they reroll each Virtue on d12+d6 and keep the result if higher.

When a character becomes **Old** they reroll each Virtue on d12+d6 and keep the result if lower.<p>
#### *Old characters lose d12 VIG at the end of each Age.<p>If this takes them to VIG 0 they die peacefully.*

## **ADVANCING TIME**

At the end of each session, or during a natural break in their journey, the group decides how much time will reasonably pass:

- **None:** Pick up where you left off.
- **Weeks:** Continue on to the next significant seasonal event.
- **Months:** Move to the next Season.
- **Years:** Begin a new Age in Spring.

If uncertain, roll:

## PASSAGE OF TIME

| Roll    | Result                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1**   | Season or Age turns **now**                |
| **2-3** | Season or Age turns **after next session** |
| **4-6** | The Season or Age **continues**            |

Between Seasons and Ages, Knights guard the Realm and each choose a pursuit.

## BETWEEN SEASONS

Restore Virtues and choose one:

- **Pilgrimage**: Learn about an unknown part of the Realm.
- **Courtesy**: Establish a new contact or earn a favour.
- **Service**: Make a small improvement to the Realm.

## BETWEEN AGES

Restore Virtues, gain 1 Glory, choose one:

- **Duty**: Make a significant improvement to the Realm.
- **Succession**: Establish a successor and/or have them Knighted.
- **Legacy**: Your successor gains half of your current Glory.

## **UNRESOLVED SITUATIONS**

If an important situation is left unresolved before moving to the next Season or Age, roll d6 to see how it changes:

| Roll    | Result                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | It goes as **bad as it could possibly go**. |
| **2-3** | It gets **worse.**                          |
| **4-6** | It gets **better.**                         |

Travelling consumes a whole Phase of the day and uses one of 3 methods:

- **Trek:** 1 Hex on foot or steed.
- **Gallop:** 2 Hexes on a non-Exhausted steed. The steed loses d6 VIG.
- **Cruise:** 3 Hexes by boat, or by steed on a rarely-found proper road.

When ending a phase in Wilderness, roll:

|     | WILDERNESS ROLL                                           |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Encounter the next Omen from a random Myth in this Realm. |
| 2-3 | Encounter the next Omen from the nearest Myth.            |
| 4-6 | Encounter the Hex's Landmark.<br>Otherwise all clear.     |

### HOSPITALITY

- When sleeping indoors, do not make a Wilderness Roll.
> Manners dictate that hospitality be granted to travelling Knights
- Longer stays warrant a favour in return.

#### **CAMPING**

When sleeping outdoors make a Wilderness Roll as normal, ignoring Landmarks. Hostile Omens prevent proper sleep, while others may not occur at all if they are improbable as nighttime activity.

#### SUPPLIES

Knights gather food, water, and firewood as they travel, so these are not tracked. In situations where essential needs are deprived the Company each lose d6 VIG each morning.

## NIGHT

Travelling or exploring at night causes the Company to lose d6 SPI each. If they lack a guide and light they are also travelling blind.

#### SLEEP

Each morning, all who did not get proper sleep the previous day lose d6 CLA.

#### WINTER

Anybody camping or travelling at night in Winter loses d6 vig. Most Realms also risk dire weather during Winter (see opposite).

#### **OMENS**

Each Myth has 6 Omens, listed in the order in which they are encountered. The first encounter with a specific Myth is always Omen 1, the second Omen 2 etc.

Remember **primacy of action** (p16). If the players want to hunt for the Wyvern's nest they don't have to wait for that Omen to appear if they take action themselves.

#### **MYTH HEXES**

Ending a phase in the Hex containing a Myth always reveals its next Omen without making a Wilderness Roll. When possible, the Knights also get the drop on the Omen.

#### BARRIERS

Travel through a Barrier is not normally possible, though locals might know a way. Attempting to travel through a Barrier wastes that Phase of the day, but still causes a Wilderness Roll.

#### OTHER TRAVELLING TABLES

Travellers who find themselves roaming without a proper sense of direction, or shrouded by darkness or mist, must roll when they try to move to a new Hex.

| 1                | Circle back to where you started.         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2-3              | Drift a Hex to the Left (2) or Right (3). |
| 4-6              | Progress as planned.                      |
| TRAVELLING BLIND |                                           |

When travelling in lands at the mercy of dire weather, roll at the start of each Phase.

| DIRE WEATHER |                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | Dire weather. You can't leave the Hex and can't get proper sleep.                   |
| 2-3          | Looming threat. If this is rolled a second consecutive time, treat as dire weather. |
| 4-6          | Fine weather for travel.                                                            |

When arriving in a Holding, roll to gauge the local mood.

|     | LOCAL MOOD |                                         |
| --- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1   |            | Occupied by a looming or recent woe.    |
| 2-3 |            | There is a sense of things in decline . |
| 4-6 |            | A fine mood and all seems well enough.  |

## Exploration

**THE LAY OF THE LAND**

Each Hex is large and diverse, a land within the land. Some may spend their whole lives within one. A forest Hex might have cliffs, streams, clearings, and caves.

Use Spark Tables() and the prompts at the base of each Knight and Myth spread to help fill the blanks in your Hexes.

## **EXPLORATION ACTIONS**

When ruling exploration actions, follow the standard Action Procedure(). In particular, consider whether the action will take a whole Phase of the day to carry out.

As with other Actions, the players should know the risks before they commit to it.

If the Action calls for a Save the Company decides who rolls, using their Virtue.

Even if they fail the Save, the goal might still be achievable, but now faces an obstacle, a hostile encounter, or an additional cost.

While the cause and consequence of failure can be personal, they also represent the whims of nature, bad weather, shifting land.

If it is unclear which Virtue to use, consider the main activity involved in the risky part:

- **Vigour:** Strength or physical stamina.
- **Clarity:** Senses or mental quickness.
- **Spirit:** Social or emotional influence.

## **SEARCHING**

It takes a whole Phase to carry out a surface level sweep of an entire Hex, thoroughly search for something known to exist there, or find a vantage point.

## **VISION**

From a vantage point it's possible to get an overview of the current Hex and a general sense of what lies in neighbouring hexes, but not specific details.

**GATHERING FOLKLORE**

Everybody knows something about Myths. How much depends on who they are.

**Vassals** know about their nearest Myth, and its general direction. If it is adjacent to their home then they know its precise location. They know Landmarks in their home and neighbouring Hexes.

**Knights** and **Vagabonds** have roamed enough to know about a random Myth of the Realm and its rough direction. They also know of the nearest Landmark.

All of the above know **rumours** that warn of dangers, but not how to avoid or undo them.

**Seers** know the **rules** of all Myths, their secrets, and their locations. They know their weaknesses, and cures to their maladies. They know all Landmarks in the Realm. Such vast knowledge isn't given freely.

For example, take Myth 6, the Goblin.

Omen 2 describes "A lost lad, full of stories. Claims a little old man called him into the woods."

All locals know about children going missing, and stories of a strange old man in the woods off to the north-east.

A Seer knows that this is, in fact, the Goblin, and would know that he can only claim lost things, unable to steal for himself. They even know where to find his lair.

## Dominion

## **RULING A DOMAIN**

In return for pledging loyalty to the Seat of Power, a Holding might be granted to a Knight or influential Vassal. This forms a Domain. Wilderness Hexes and their Landmarks formally fall under the dominion of their nearest Holding.

## **THE COUNCIL**

Prestigious seats must be filled for a Domain to run smoothly. Though you may grant and revoke these roles, those who are scorned rarely go quietly.

**Steward:** Ruling in your absence, carrying your authority and the key to the treasury.

**Marshall:** Training and equipping soldiers, mustering them in times of war.

**Sheriff:** Monitoring threats within your Realm and even within your walls.

**Envoy:** Managing neighbours and providing hospitality to visitors.

**The Circle:** Rulers often invite worthy visiting Knights to sit alongside the Council as equals, an ancient tradition.

Members of your Council can be assigned to tasks. Depending on the scope these could take a Phase, a Week, or a full Season. These are handled just as normal actions(), with failure typically causing a **Crisis**.

## **THE COURT**

Those who serve outside the Council.

**Retainers:** Vassals taken on by individual Council members to aid in their work.

**Courtiers:** Commoners with lesser responsibilities or ceremonial honours, usually holding higher ambitions.

**Petitioners:** Representatives from outside of the Court, granted an audience to seek aid, counsel, or justice.

**Seers:** Although they live in their Sanctums they occasionally visit Court or send acolytes in their stead.

## **CRISES**

Ruling a Domain is an exercise in ongoing disaster management.

At the start of a Season or when returning from a long absence, roll:

## **CRISIS ROLL**

| Roll    | Result                                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | **Calamity**: Immediately gain 2 Crises. |
| **2-3** | **Dilemma**: Choose between 2 Crises.    |
| **4-6** | **Prosperity**: Times are good.          |

Crises apply to the whole Domain, not a single character, and remain until resolved. They can be chosen by the Referee, or rolled:

- **1. Chaos** *Lawlessness in the land* Resolution: Enforce a sense of justice.
- **2. Debt -** *Dire need of coffer and coin* Resolution: Restock the treasury.
- **3. Famine -** *Empty plates, empty fields* Resolution: Get food into the stores.
- **4. Misery -** *Vassals question why they toil* Resolution: Raise the spirits of the people.
- **5. Panic -** *The weak tremble with unease* Resolution: Ensure the Vassals feel safe.
- **6. Doubt -** *Seeds of betrayal against you* Resolution: Assert your authority to rule.

## **MISRULE**

If a season ends with 3 or more unresolved Crises then the Domain goes into misrule. Vassals revolt, Knights leave, and pretenders move in on their claims.

## **CLAIMING A SEAT OF POWER**

A Seat of Power carries similar problems to a Holding, elevated to a larger scale. Threats arise from within your Court, within your Realm, and from beyond your borders.

*.*

## **MUSTERING TROOPS**

A typical Seat of Power can muster 3 Warbands, other Holdings 2. The Marshall determines their training and armament.

## **TAXES, TITHES, & LEVIES**

Standard collections  keep the Domain running without too much strain. A Steward can squeeze more from their Vassals for a war or great project, but must roll:

| Roll    | INCREASED COLLECTIONS                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | Immediate misrule.                              |
| **2-3** | Your coffers are filled, but take a **Crisis**. |
| **4-6** | The Vassals **pay willingly**, mostly.          |

## **COURTLY CONFLICT**

Courtiers breed problems, especially when they hold leverage over their ruler, whether family influence, dark secrets, or military might. Here a ruler must tread carefully, as obvious solutions always leave at least one party feeling mistreated.

Every Season brings some drama. Spark Tables  can help to describe this. Roll to see how you're involved:

|     | DRAMA IN COURT                   |
| --- | -------------------------------- |
| 1   | You are personally involved.     |
| 2-3 | You are involved by association. |
| 4-6 | You are not involved.            |

## **CONQUEST**

Knights live between two worlds. One of rank, oath, and rule of the worthy. The other of chaos, brutality, and rule of the strong.

Often, having the audacity to seat yourself in a Holding is enough to make you the ruler.

Holdings and Realms seized by force and left unchallenged tend to have a period of turmoil before adapting to the new status quo.

## **GRAND DESIGNS**

Work on **existing** buildings or infrastructure is generally completed by the next Season.

**New** buildings or infrastructure can be completed in a Season.

**Grand** projects such as castles and roads require an entire Age of work.

## Nature

The majority of any Realm is wilderness, where even rough trails are a rare sight. Roll 2d12 on a Spark Table and combine the results for an improvisational prompt.

## Knights

Each Knight can be used for a player character or non-player Knights who are encountered wandering or ruling. Generally each player should have a different type of Knight.

Some Realms refer to Knights by honorific titles and ranks, others their given name and home, while most use their full knightly title or simply "Knight."

This is not an exhaustive list, and even those listed Knights may differ as the mantle is passed on.

Each page also includes the Seer who granted their Knighthood, witnessing the pledging of their Oath.

Each Myth lists its Omens and the cast of beings who are associated with it.

Entering or exploring the Myth's Hex always reveals its next Omen, remembering Primacy of Action .

The Hex itself is visually tied to the Myth.

When the group feels that a Myth is resolved the Knights each gain 1 Glory and a new Myth replaces it in the next Season.

Myths may appear at odds with their Realm, such as The Sea in a desert.

Still, these Myths must be brought to pass, so Realm and Myth can shift as needed.

- Lost Knight from a distant place. She claims to have fallen through a shadow. A Shrouded Guide follows, seeking the toll.
- Narrow, twisted cave. Clanging within. A shrouded smith is forging a coldsword (2d8 hefty, ignores metal armour). It shatters if unsheathed in daylight.
- Heavy black cloth woven with indigo. If hung, opens to a place you want to be. Within, a dozen hands in the darkness require a toll of silver or blood. They will take either by force if needed.
- Broad, lilac-leaved trees. No artificial light can shine beneath. Five Shrouded Guides seeking to claim an owed toll.
- A creeping darkness, then suddenly within the Underworld. A dark reflection of our world. Without a Shrouded Guide the only exit is into a distant Realm.

# City Quest

For the oath, for the glory, through sorrow and ache The City, that quest to which no Knight can make

A Company worthy of the City Quest continues their knightly duties as normal, but when they would encounter an Omen from a random Myth by rolling 1 on the Wilderness Roll, they instead encounter an Omen from the City Quest.

To determine the Omen, roll d12 and add the number of Omens of the City that the Company have already encountered, adding 0 if this is their first. In the case of a duplicate take the next Omen down the list. Treat rolls of higher than 24 as 24 instead.

After encountering Omen 18 or higher the City Quest ends.

## Omens

- A lost traveller in finely cut cloth, armed with a strange device. He's desperate to get back to the City, telling stories of a place of coloured lights and brick towers.
- On the horizon, a jagged skyline of towers, domes, impossible bridges, dotted with warm light. It fades in the next Phase.
- Four strange raiders stroll up, mocking the Knights as primitives. They attempt to rob anything of value the Knights have.
- A broken trail appears to have a golden hue, gradually turning to slabs of sparkling stone, impossibly smooth. After a while the road fades back to nothing.
- The City Knight, returning from the City. She advises you to turn back.

- Three great shapes move in the sky, casting shadows over the land. Like huge, dark eggs, a growling hum. With a chorus of bangs they send an explosive barrage (2d10 *Blast*) down onto the Company before drifting off to the horizon.
- A rider in ugly red plate. She claims to be the Arch-Hellion of Jules, pressing a claim on the nearest Seat of Power. She is from the City, but smugly refuses to share any information about it.
- A wide tunnel through a sheer cliff face, the other side visible. Partway through the tunnel, a rumble, a whistle, a *Blast* of white smoke. Anyone who doesn't vacate the tunnel is struck by an immense force (3d10), which vanishes before it exits the other side of the tunnel.
- Green-grey smoke washes over the land for the rest of the season. It burns slightly, but no serious effect.
- A Warband of Knight-Catchers charge, aiming to preserve you for display in a museum that does not exist yet.

- A metal wagon lies in ruin, various canisters and pipes lie broken within the wreckage, like nothing you've seen before. Amongst the wreckage, a metal chest contains a beautiful crystal bottle filled with fiery liquor, and a pouch of impossibly clear diamonds.
- A woman in a black coat, with a broad hat. She's a science-mystic, trading wonders from the City in return for guidance to mystical places in the Realm.
- A pottery-like stairway leading downward in a spiral. A green-tiled tunnel with soft light, soothing music. The exit leads to a distant point in the Realm.
- A wooden case with six rifles (2d10 long) and a good amount of ammunition.
- A sponge-like, metallic material has burst forth from the soil, slowly growing from beneath. Narrow tunnels lead into a chamber where ten silver ghouls sleep.
- A towering, square mountain. The slightest touch reduces it to rubble, releasing the brick giant within.
- Scattered plates and wires. A faint voice from a blinking light. You may ask the voice one question, which it will answer with certainty. It knows everything.
- An open plain. You are utterly certain that this is where the City must be built.
- A vast, empty, glittering castle. The City will grow from here with the right ruler.
- The City. A hellish smoke-choked factory.
- The City. All coloured lights, strange machines, and discordant music.
- The stars look closer. You feel a force drawing you toward them, into the void.
- A liquid light roars over you. Embrace the end or abandon your quest.
- You see now. The City was a lie.

# Referee Principles & Best Practices

    Primacy of Action: Established fiction always supersedes random prompts or Omens. If a prompt contradicts a past event, discard or adapt the prompt.

    Transparent Odds: State risks and probabilities clearly before the player commits to a roll. Do not hide the difficulty.

    Transparency in Luck: Roll dice in the open. Avoid "fudging" results to save players.

    Generous Interpretation: Assume character competence. If a player forgets a mundane precaution (e.g., extinguishing torches), assume the character did it unless established otherwise.

    Information Availability: Give players enough information to make informed choices. Do not hide critical sensory details behind rolls.

    Fail Forward: Death is a part of the game. If a character dies, introduce a successor immediately. Do not retcon lethal results if the rules were followed.

    Soft Starts: Begin sessions or encounters with "soft" consequences or threats that allow player reaction before damage occurs.

    Dynamic Combat: Change the battlefield or enemy tactics every round (e.g., reinforcements, terrain shifts, morale breaks). Combat should not be static attrition.

    Use the Oath: When players are stuck or indecisive, remind them of their Knightly Oath to guide action.

    Improvised Rulings: If a rule is forgotten, make a logical ruling to keep the game moving. Do not halt play to look up obscure mechanics unless critical.

    Ask, Don't Guess: Ask players what their intent is or what they want to know. Do not assume their character's knowledge or motivations.s
