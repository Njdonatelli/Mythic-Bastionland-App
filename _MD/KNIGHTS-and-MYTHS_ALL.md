## Knights

Each Knight can be used for a player character or non-player Knights who are encountered wandering or ruling. Generally each player should have a different type of Knight.

Some Realms refer to Knights by honorific titles and ranks, others their given name and home, while most use their full knightly title or simply "Knight."

This is not an exhaustive list, and even those listed Knights may differ as the mantle is passed on.

Each page also includes the Seer who granted their Knighthood, witnessing the pledging of their Oath.

Each Myth lists its Omens and the cast of beings who are associated with it.

Entering or exploring the Myth's Hex always reveals its next Omen, remembering Primacy of Action .

The Hex itself is visually tied to the Myth.

When the group feels that a Myth is resolved the Knights each gain 1 Glory and a new Myth replaces it in the next Season.

Myths may appear at odds with their Realm, such as The Sea in a desert.

Still, these Myths must be brought to pass, so Realm and Myth can shift as needed.

## The Lost Seer

VIG 10, CLA 9, SPI 7, 2GD

- Constantly being rubbed with psychotropic tinctures, parts of their body seeming to dissipate from reality.
- Sees things that have been lost in a hazy vision of their current location.
- Knows they will lose their sight if they advise directly how to find something.

> On toes it crept just out o' sight The petty hoarder full o' spite

## Omens

- Weeping huntsman, cursing everyone. Looking for his lost bloodhound who tended to him during injury.
- A lost lad, full of stories. Claims a little old man called him into the woods.
- Oppressive branches, tripping roots. A cloaked old man calls out, lost. If alerted he cries out just before he is dragged into the ground, taken to the lost realm.
- The lost pets are running wild. If spotted they immediately run back toward the secret door to the lost realm. One drops a strange metallic bone, repellent to birds.
- A dark clearing. Any deals made here are bound by fate. The Goblin offers a trade. A valuable lost thing in return for a favour he can call in later.
- Suddenly dragged to the realm of lost things. Tunnels under piles of bric-a-brac. The Goblin gloats from atop his pile. Freedom is only granted for a binding favour, which the Goblin will enforce.

### KNIGHTED BY...

## The Cured Seer

VIG 9, CLA 4, SPI 8, 2GD

- Preserved in salt, completely desiccated and unable to move.
- Barely speaks, but offers manic visions to those who taste their salt.
- Wants to live forever and witness the end of all things.

**Person**: Aggressive carver ~ Name: Wodwale ~ Characteristic: Meticulously clean **Object**: Vow sunflower ~ Beast: Tiny chameleon ~ State: Observing ~ Theme: Anger

Each stab, each cut, each severance, regrown in warpsome matter All stretched and swollen, big and bent, a groaning soul atatter

## Omens

- In an itchy marsh, a severed, rubbery arm pulls itself along. Claws at anybody that interferes. Has no sense of direction, eventually withering to dense, dead flesh.
- A tiny chameleon watches from a crooked branch. Hisses a warning if anybody passes near, stirring the Troll in the nearby trees, fleeing back to its home.
- A burglar is fleeing from an abandoned cave, a home carved into the earth. Clumsy furniture cobbled from rock and mud. Blood on the ground, smashed bones, another dead troll limb. The burglar found nothing of value in there.
- The Troll drags a dying warhorse back toward its new cave. A Knight lays dead.
- Bronze, shimmering pond amongst a bog of fly-infested reeds. Disturbing the water grants a vision of the Troll being attacked by soldiers with axes, hacking the creature to bits.
- Split from head to pelvis, the Troll holds itself together as it rampages, craving meat to aid the regeneration.

- The Two-Hearted Knight bellows at the Sea, trying to repel the water with their coral ring. They don't know that they must be submerged in the water to command it.
- A great storm begins, and won't stop until the wave has arrived. Saltwater rises from all water sources, the land is flooded, and harvest ruined.

### Omens

- Six carrion storks pick at webbed corpses of a Knight, a Squire, and steeds.
- A makeshift trail suddenly gives way to a wide tunnel network. This labyrinth leads to the Myth Hex, but the Spider guards it.

- The Spider Herald watches over a gloomy mound, warning passers-by to keep their distance. The mound conceals a nest of writhing spider eggs. Any interference summons the Spider to defend his young.
- The Spider Herald arrives, beckoning the Company over. She inquires about their prowess, and if they seem worthy she cheerily informs them that they are now the Prey of the Spider, a great honour.
- The Spider bursts from the ground. He's been tracking the Company and fights until wounded, when he withdraws underground to return when fully healed.

# City Quest

For the oath, for the glory, through sorrow and ache The City, that quest to which no Knight can make

A Company worthy of the City Quest continues their knightly duties as normal, but when they would encounter an Omen from a random Myth by rolling 1 on the Wilderness Roll, they instead encounter an Omen from the City Quest.

To determine the Omen, roll d12 and add the number of Omens of the City that the Company have already encountered, adding 0 if this is their first. In the case of a duplicate take the next Omen down the list. Treat rolls of higher than 24 as 24 instead.

After encountering Omen 18 or higher the City Quest ends.

## Omens

- A lost traveller in finely cut cloth, armed with a strange device. He's desperate to get back to the City, telling stories of a place of coloured lights and brick towers.
- On the horizon, a jagged skyline of towers, domes, impossible bridges, dotted with warm light. It fades in the next Phase.
- Four strange raiders stroll up, mocking the Knights as primitives. They attempt to rob anything of value the Knights have.
- A broken trail appears to have a golden hue, gradually turning to slabs of sparkling stone, impossibly smooth. After a while the road fades back to nothing.
- The City Knight, returning from the City. She advises you to turn back.

- Three great shapes move in the sky, casting shadows over the land. Like huge, dark eggs, a growling hum. With a chorus of bangs they send an explosive barrage (2d10 blast) down onto the Company before drifting off to the horizon.
- A rider in ugly red plate. She claims to be the Arch-Hellion of Jules, pressing a claim on the nearest Seat of Power. She is from the City, but smugly refuses to share any information about it.
- A wide tunnel through a sheer cliff face, the other side visible. Partway through the tunnel, a rumble, a whistle, a blast of white smoke. Anyone who doesn't vacate the tunnel is struck by an immense force (3d10), which vanishes before it exits the other side of the tunnel.
- Green-grey smoke washes over the land for the rest of the season. It burns slightly, but no serious effect.
- A Warband of Knight-Catchers charge, aiming to preserve you for display in a museum that does not exist yet.

- A metal wagon lies in ruin, various canisters and pipes lie broken within the wreckage, like nothing you've seen before. Amongst the wreckage, a metal chest contains a beautiful crystal bottle filled with fiery liquor, and a pouch of impossibly clear diamonds.
- A woman in a black coat, with a broad hat. She's a science-mystic, trading wonders from the City in return for guidance to mystical places in the Realm.
- A pottery-like stairway leading downward in a spiral. A green-tiled tunnel with soft light, soothing music. The exit leads to a distant point in the Realm.
- A wooden case with six rifles (2d10 long) and a good amount of ammunition.
- A sponge-like, metallic material has burst forth from the soil, slowly growing from beneath. Narrow tunnels lead into a chamber where ten silver ghouls sleep.
- A towering, square mountain. The slightest touch reduces it to rubble, releasing the brick giant within.
- Scattered plates and wires. A faint voice from a blinking light. You may ask the voice one question, which it will answer with certainty. It knows everything.
- An open plain. You are utterly certain that this is where the City must be built.
- A vast, empty, glittering castle. The City will grow from here with the right ruler.
- The City. A hellish smoke-choked factory.
- The City. All coloured lights, strange machines, and discordant music.
- The stars look closer. You feel a force drawing you toward them, into the void.
- A liquid light roars over you. Embrace the end or abandon your quest.
- You see now. The City was a lie.
